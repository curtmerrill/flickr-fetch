# Flickr Fetch

This script grabs some basic information about photos in a
Flickr album and saves a json file with that information to a
specified location. 

## Usage

Sign up for a [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) key.

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Make a copy of `fetch_config_sample.py` and name it `fetch_config.py`.

Edit `fetch_config.py` to match your needs.

**Caution:** The `fetch_config.py` file contains secrets. Do NOT make it public.
The file is already included in `.gitignore` but **be careful**.
